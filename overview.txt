    Basics:
    Want to get a website that lists appartment prices in your area?
    If there is protection you will need to use selenium to scrape the website.
    Parse the website to get the price of the apartment.
    Make it into a standized format so it's stored as a time series (boomer)
    Store the data in a database.

    sites to use
    https://jmaldencenter.com/floor-plans/
    https://500oceanavenue.com/floorplans/
    https://altarevolution.com/floor-plans/

    """

    first step get all units using parsed as json from first link of all units

    the results are not currently in the linux standard format, windows


    have results for one unit of jmalden, need to get all units, then move forward with storing it within a database

    replace json_data['Workflow']['ActivityGroups'][0]['GroupActivities'][0]['Floorplans'][i] with variables
    """

    we need to pass in, unit id, selectedunitsiteid, and floorplan id

    what to add for unit pricing, so json data will change, so we need to pass values into it
    params are the same, headers are the same

    move in date needs to dynamic

    think about json data and whether or not it makes sense to use i with that variable and then to pass that in as data with that object

    currently have issues with the date of possenion within json data, a workaround is to use the date of possession as the date of the json data that uses
    a try except block, you should understand a better implimentation of this, impliment it in the future and then make the date dynamic

    fix prints and logging to do both in one statement

    next dictionary object when you get back

    mongodb is currently complaing about the lack of an extension

    Mongodb implimentation now works, add support for second rental site now

    rename current name to another function, make new main that uses different functions based on site names

    add bedroom and bathroom count to json data

    add move in data, and make it dynamic
